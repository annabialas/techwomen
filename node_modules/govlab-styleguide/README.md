# govlab-styleguide

A styleguide / lightweight frontend framework for GovLab websites.

This is a living styleguide generated by [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) and built on top of a super lightweight custom build of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which aims to be easily reusable for any project within the GovLab ecosystem.

## Getting Started <a name="start"></a>

To use the styleguide in your project, simply run the following command in the base directory of your project:
```
npm i --save-dev govlab-styleguide
```

## Development <a name="dev"></a>

To develop the styleguide, clone the git repository, and run the following in the project directory:
```
npm in
gulp
```

To deploy the living styleguide site to github pages run the following command:
```
gulp deploy
```

**NOTE: before publishing new versions of this package to npm, make sure you build the site (eg. `gulp build`) in order to get the latest built dist css/js**
